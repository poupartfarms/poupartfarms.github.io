Recently it was posited to me that veganism can not be an intersectional movement because it would require us to view oppressed humans as sub-human.  The person further went on to point out that historically, minorities have been denigrated through comparison to nonhuman animals.  This last statement is true — it can be seen from the way that thew Jews were treated in Nazi Germany to the way that African Americans are still treated in the USA to day.

There are, however, a few things wrong with this argument.  Firstly, intersectionality focuses on the systems of oppression, not necessarily on the victims of oppression.  Therefor, the victims of oppression do not have to have anything in common for there to be similarities in the way that they are being oppressed.  
  
However, that still misses the larger issue here, which is the inherent speciesism of the idea that nonhuman animals are somehow less-than.  In a sense, it is this pre-conditioned belief, a belief that most humans share, that makes the comparison between oppressed groups and nonhuman animals so upsetting.  Aside from the obvious issue of the oppression of a group of humans, should we not also question the societally conditioned belief that humans are somehow “above” or “better than” nonhumans animals?

How do we rank animals?  Dolphins are better swimmers than us.  Cheetahs are faster runners.  Cows are stronger than us.  Birds can fly.  We are good at many things, mostly at understanding our world and building on that knowledge.  We are also really good at destroying the planet.  Genocide and ecocide seem to be particular fortes of ours.  In the short span of human existence, we have caused the extinction of thousands of species.  We kill more than any other species of animal.  I guess that makes us “better”.  
  
The same person went on to write: “Bottom line, if you think animal life is as valuable as human life… and think eating chickens is just as bad as cops gunning down black and native people, then yes you are a white supremacist.”  
  
Of course, this is also a logical fallacy, specifically a [false dilemma](http://www.logicallyfallacious.com/index.php/logical-fallacies/94-false-dilemma).  For one, it ignores the fact that humans are animals.  It also positions eating a chicken with the killing of a human.  These are two separate and distinct acts.  It would be more appropriate to compare the unjust killing of a nonhuman animal with the unjust killing of a human, or the eating of a nonhuman animal with the eating of an animal.  It further ignores other options — what if I also think that the unjust killing of white people is as bad as the unjust killing of a nonhuman animal?  Would that still make me a white supremacist?  Most importantly however, it ignores the fact that it is quite possible to hold both actions as abhorrent, without having to give a hierarchy of bad to them.  Getting into the weighing of evils is messy business.  Do we count volume?  Does it matter that it isn’t 1 chicken for 1 black life, but approximately 150 000 000 000 nonhuman animals killed per year versus the approximately 1000 thousand police-caused deaths in the USA in 2014?  Do we consider their lives, growing up in poverty and the impact on their quality of life? What about personality type? Character? Age?  The question is messy and has already been addressed ad nauseam. (see: “The Dog in the Lifeboat: An Exchange” by Tom Regan and Peter Singer, or “Introduction to Animal Rights: Your Child or the Dog?” by Gary L. Francine)

Are the “just as bad”? No.  They are different kinds of bad.  They are different kinds of horrors.  Which situation is worse is going to depend on so many factors that are not discussed.

But the beauty is that while we seek to address our own privilege with regards to race, and while we strive to be good allies and to stand alongside other marginalized humans to support them in their fights for justice, we can also seek to address our own privilege with regards to species.  We can embrace veganism, not as the modern “don’t eat animals” watered down meaning of the word, but as it was originally meant, to seek to break down unjustified hierarchy and recognize that nonhuman animals value their lives as much as we value our.  To give nonhuman animals moral consideration when we are making decisions that effect them, such as (but not limited to) what to eat, what to wear, and what entertains us.  
  
To quote Angela Davis: “I think it’s the right moment to talk about it because it is part of a revolutionary perspective – how can we not only discover more compassionate relations with human beings but how can we develop compassionate relations with the other creatures with whom we share this planet and that would mean challenging the whole capitalist industrial form of food production.”~~~~
