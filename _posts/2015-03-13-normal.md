I don’t hold “normal” in very high esteem. Normal in our 
society is violence. It is racism, specisism, sexism,
heterosexism. It is buying things you don’t need and making
people work crappy jobs for little pay. Normal shouldn’t be
valued. It is when people act outside of the normal that
the world is changed.

I wish we lived in a world that embraced the abnormal
instead of fearing it.
