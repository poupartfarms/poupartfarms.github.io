> “To be strong, the movement must consist of people who are self-critical, truth loving, scientific, careful in judgment and eager to yield to evidence even if it tends to weaken their case. Those unable or unwilling to pass such a test are a liability.” — Donald Watson (No. 1 Vol. 2 - “The Vegetarian” - SPRING 1948 p. 23-27)
