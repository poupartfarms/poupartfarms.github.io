My first real exposure to overt racism, something that many people experience 
on a regular basis, came 3 years ago today, in a way that was all the more
horrifying because it was not me that was the primary target, but my children
and some of their caregivers.

For those who don't know me, I am a white cis man who is married to a white 
cis woman. We live a solidly middle class existence in a gentrifying blue
collar neighbourhood in Montreal. We have French names, speak both French and
English, and are well educated. I say this not because I am particularly proud
of any of it, but to paint a picture of how privileged we are, and why it is
that I have never experienced overt prejudice.

To set the stage, the [Parti Québécois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parti_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois)
had been elected with a minority government, and were playing populist identity
politics in the hopes of garnering a majority government in the next election.
Identity politics are almost invariables racist and xenophobic in nature, and
this was no different. After much rhetoric, the PQ officially put forth what
they called [The Quebec Charter of Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Charter_of_Values)
on September 10th, 2013.

According to the Minister of Public Security, hate crimes in Quebec almost 
doubled in the following year, from 167 reported crimes in 2013, to 257 
reported crimes in 2014. Statistics are still missing for 2015 and 2016.

It was one of these incidents of hatred that we got caught up in one fateful
morning. Thankfully, virtually all of the violence was online and in the media,
and so our children, and their educators, were not directly exposed to it. But
the effects on the educators and the owners of the daycare were non the less 
terrible.

You see, the daycare was owned and operated by a Muslim family, and some of
of their employees wore the niqab when out and about in the neighbourhood.
This was not a secret to us when we registered our children there, nor was it
a secret to any of the other families. The daycare clients were a mixture of
our neighbourhood -- some Muslim, some Quebecois de souche ("pure blooded
Quebecois"), some anglophones, some immigrants.

We were drawn in by the Montesori style educational program, the gentle nature
of the educators, the pluralism that reflected our community, and ironically,
the secularism of the daycare, which is far, far  more secular than the public
school my older children now attend.

One day around lunch time, our kids were on their way back from the park, and
it just so happened that two of the educators that day were wearing the niqab.
While this was nothing new to the people who lived in the neighbourhood, a
real estate agent from somewhere else on the island was visiting a property and
could not resist her racist urge to take a picture of the group (seen above)
and post it to Facebook -- uncensored (a likely violation of Quebec's 
[Charter of Rights and Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Charter_of_Human_Rights_and_Freedoms), 
under which privacy is a respected right.)

The results were immediate. The ground had been made fertile for hatred, thanks
in part to ongoing rhetoric from the PQ and other politicians, and the photo
went viral.

The comments kept me from sleeping for days. They included violent threats 
(translated) such as "2 bullets, it's hunting season, let's go!", or 
"I hope that they will be raped by pigs, and then burnt." Some simply 
Islamaphobic, such as "Islam is the crack cocain of the religions... We don't
need either of those poisons..." or "Your kids teachers are now radical muzzies
[sic]", and some were both "Put the muslim [sic] down like you would a deranged
dog."

We held emergency meetings, all of the parents and daycare workers. We agreed
that we would take a position of solidarity, and that particularly those of us
who were white and had French family names would step up and use our privilege
to defend and support these people, these members of our society who gave so
much, and who were now under attack.  But it was not easy. We wrote an
[open letter](https://www.scribd.com/document/186016584/We-Are-the-Parents),
however the French media did not want to use our full names out of fear for
our personal safety and the safety of our children. My partner went on national
news, basically saying WTF and asking how it could have come to this in a
society that prides itself on being open and multicultural.

Eventually, as these things do, it ran its course, and life moved on. Some
families were too spooked by the incident and decided to move their children
to a new daycare. The daycare decided to hire additional non-niqabe workers to 
take the kids out to the park, and eventually, the denizens of Quebec decided 
that the Charter was the wrong way to go and voted the PQ out of power.

But not a November has gone by where I have not thought back to this incident.
The fear, the horror, the anger, mixed with the love for our neighbours, and
the joy of the expressions of solidarity from everyone involved. I can finally
think about it without it making me want to cry, so there is that. Part of me
still wants to sue the woman who took that photo, though, that is mostly just
me feeling vindictive. Clearly, I still have not forgiven her thoughtless
bigoted act.

And now, here we are with Trump, a racist demagogue who's rhetoric against
Muslims has undoubtedly contributed to rise of anti-Muslim hate crimes to 
levels not seen since post 9/11. Rates for 2015 were up 
[61%](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2015-hate-crime-statistics-released)
in the USA vs 2014. By all accounts, 2016 is gearing up to be even worse.

Donald Trump, who has made no secret of his racism, homophobia, misogyny, and
general bigotry, to the point where it won him the support of the KKK, 
neo-nazis, and the [alt-right](http://www.dailywire.com/news/9441/actual-conservatives-guide-alt-right-8-things-you-michael-knowles),
has recently appointed his campaign CEO [Steve Bannon](http://www.salon.com/2016/11/14/steve-bannon-runs-an-anti-semitic-website-is-a-misogynist-and-will-be-one-of-donald-trumps-senior-advisors/).
[Steve Bannon](http://heavy.com/news/2016/11/steve-bannon-stephen-steven-quotes-trump-racist-alt-right-allegations-jew-jewish-anti-semitism-israel-breitbart-divorce-white-nationalism/) 
is the former head of Breitbart News, an alt-right publication
known for its strong anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant views, who 
[self describes](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/)
the movement thusly:

> There are many things that separate the alternative right from old-school 
  racist skinheads (to whom they are often idiotically compared), but one 
  thing stands out above all else: intelligence.

It is little surprise that overt acts of racism and other hate crimes are on
the rise, and not just in the USA, but in Canada as well.

While it should be obvious that not all Trump supporters are racists, or
homophobic, or misogynistic, or otherwise bigoted, at least not more than the
average person in the West, what is clear is that they have put their desire
for Trump to win above the rights and indeed very lives my friends and family.
To cheer for a Trump victory is to celebrate the awful, and it is to throw my
[children's generation under the bus](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/noam-chomsky-donald-trump-climate-change-denier-global-warming-race-to-disaster-republicans-most-a7418296.html). How do I answer when my children say ask
"will global warming destroy the world before I am old?" when the answer is
"probably"?
