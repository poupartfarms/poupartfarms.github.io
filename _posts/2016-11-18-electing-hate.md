My first real exposure to overt racism, something that many people experience 
on a regular basis, came 3 years ago today, in a way that was all the more
horrifying because it was not me that was the primary target, but my children
and some of their caregivers.

For those who don't know me, I am a white cis man who is married to a white 
cis woman. We live a solidly middle class existence in a gentrifying blue
collar neighbourhood in Montreal. We have French names, speak both French and
English, and are well educated. I say this not because I am particularly proud
of any of it, but to paint a picture of how privileged we are, and why it is
that I rarely experience overt prejudice.

To set the stage, the [Parti Québécois](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parti_Qu%C3%A9b%C3%A9cois)
had been elected with a minority government, and were playing populist identity
politics in the hopes of garnering a majority government in the next election.
Identity politics are almost invariables racist and xenophobic in nature, and
this was no different. After much rhetoric, the PQ officially put forth what
they called [The Quebec Charter of Values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Charter_of_Values)
on September 10th, 2013.

According to the Minister of Public Security, hate crimes in Quebec almost 
doubled in the following year, from 167 reported crimes in 2013, to 257 
reported crimes in 2014. Statistics are still missing for 2015 and 2016.

It was one of these incidents of hatred that we got caught up in one fateful
morning. Thankfully, virtually all of the violence was online and in the media,
and so our children, and their educators, were not directly exposed to it. But
the effects on the educators and the owners of the daycare were non the less 
terrible.

You see, the daycare is owned and operated by a Muslim family, and some of
of their employees wore the niqab when out and about in the neighbourhood.
This was not a secret to us when we registered our children there, nor was it
a secret to any of the other families. The daycare clients were a mixture of
our neighbourhood -- some Muslim, some Quebecois de souche ("pure blooded
Quebecois"), some anglophones, some immigrants, some a mix of the above.

We were drawn in by the Montesori style educational program, the gentle nature
of the educators, the pluralism that reflected our community, and ironically,
the secularism of the daycare, which is far, far  more secular than the public
school my older children now attend.

One day around lunch time, our kids were on their way back from the park, and
it just so happened that two of the educators that day were wearing niqabs.
While this was nothing new to the people who lived in the neighbourhood, a
real estate agent from somewhere else on the island was visiting a property and
could not resist her racist urge to take a picture of the group
and post it to Facebook -- uncensored (a likely violation of Quebec's 
[Charter of Rights and Freedoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quebec_Charter_of_Human_Rights_and_Freedoms), 
under which privacy is a respected right.) I considered reposting the photo
here, but the truth of the matter is, for many it is still a controversial
photo, and it is not the point of this post. The photo would not have been out
of place in any neighbourhood in Quebec in mid November. A group of 6 children
aged between 3 and 5, walking with two educators in the neighbourhood. Everyone
is bundled up for the weather, with the kids in winter jackets, boots, hats, 
and mittens. The two educators are likewise wearing protective clothing, but
instead of having their faces covered with scarves, they are covered with a
niqab.

The results were immediate. The ground had been made fertile for hatred, thanks
in part to ongoing rhetoric from the PQ and other politicians, and the photo
went viral.

The comments kept me from sleeping for days. They included violent threats 
(translated) such as "2 bullets, it's hunting season, let's go!", or 
"I hope that they will be raped by pigs, and then burnt." Some simply 
Islamaphobic, such as "Islam is the crack cocaine of the religions... We don't
need either of those poisons..." or "Your kids teachers are now radical muzzies
[sic]", and some were both "Put the muslim [sic] down like you would a deranged
dog." Even more disturbing were the people asking around on racist forums for
the address and/or phone number of the daycare. Those last ones gave me 
nightmares.

We held emergency meetings, all of the parents and daycare workers. We agreed
that we would take a position of solidarity, and that particularly those of us
who were white and had French family names would step up and use our privilege
to defend and support these people, these members of our community who gave so
much, and who were now under attack.  But it was not easy. We wrote an
[open letter](https://www.scribd.com/document/186016584/We-Are-the-Parents),
however the French media did not want to use our full names out of fear for
our personal safety and the safety of our children. My partner went on national
television, basically saying WTF and asking how it could have come to this in a
society that prides itself on being open and multicultural. There were radio
interviews with other parents, and [newspaper editorials](https://web.archive.org/web/20120412044826/http://www.montrealgazette.com/What+daughter+afraid/6190977/story.html).

Eventually, as these things do, it ran its course, and life moved on. Some
families were too spooked by the incident and decided to move their children
to a new daycare. The daycare decided to hire additional non-niqabe workers to 
take the kids out to the park, and eventually, the denizens of Quebec decided 
that the Charter was the wrong way to go and voted the PQ out of power, 
effectively killing it.

But not a November has gone by where I have not thought back to this incident.
The fear, the horror, the anger, mixed with the love for our neighbours, and
the joy of the expressions of solidarity from everyone involved. I can finally
think about it without it making me want to cry, so there is that. Part of me
still wants to sue the woman who took that photo, though, that is mostly just
me feeling vindictive. Clearly, I still have not forgiven her careless act that
put so many people in jeopardy.

And now, here we are with [Trump](https://wilwheaton.tumblr.com/post/153047451354/anti-trump-masterpost), 
a racist demagogue who's rhetoric against Muslims has undoubtedly contributed 
to rise of anti-Muslim hate crimes to levels not seen since post 9/11. Rates 
for 2015 were up [61%](https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2015-hate-crime-statistics-released)
in the USA vs 2014. By all accounts, 2016 is gearing up to be even worse.

Donald Trump, who has made no secret of his racism, homophobia, misogyny, and
general bigotry, to the point where it won him the support of the KKK, 
neo-nazis, and the [alt-right](http://www.dailywire.com/news/9441/actual-conservatives-guide-alt-right-8-things-you-michael-knowles),
has recently appointed his campaign CEO [Steve Bannon](http://www.salon.com/2016/11/14/steve-bannon-runs-an-anti-semitic-website-is-a-misogynist-and-will-be-one-of-donald-trumps-senior-advisors/).
[Steve Bannon](http://heavy.com/news/2016/11/steve-bannon-stephen-steven-quotes-trump-racist-alt-right-allegations-jew-jewish-anti-semitism-israel-breitbart-divorce-white-nationalism/) 
is the former head of Breitbart News, an alt-right publication
known for its strong anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant views. When asked what the
difference was between the alt-right and skinheads, the answer was 
"[intelligence](http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2016/03/29/an-establishment-conservatives-guide-to-the-alt-right/)".

It is little surprise that overt acts of racism and other hate crimes are on
the rise, and not just in the USA, but in Canada as well.

While it should be obvious that not all Trump supporters are racists, or
homophobic, or misogynistic, or otherwise bigoted, at least not more than the
average person in the West, what is clear is that they have put their desire
for Trump to win above the rights and indeed very lives my friends and family.
To cheer for a Trump victory is to celebrate the awful, and it is to throw my
[children's generation under the bus](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/noam-chomsky-donald-trump-climate-change-denier-global-warming-race-to-disaster-republicans-most-a7418296.html). How do I answer when my children say ask
"will global warming destroy the world before I am old?" when the answer is
"probably"?

I have had Trump supporters tell me that they they are not bigots and that they
don't support all of these heinous actions. But they continue to fail to see
the link between the behaviour of Trump and his inner circle and the actions
of many of his supporters. I have had Trump supporters tell me that they don't
want to be made to feel like the bad guy, that this is a historic 
anti-establishment moment, and they just want to enjoy the win, and watch the
[swamp be drained](https://www.warren.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=1298).

I get being anti-establishment. Politically, I am an [anarchist](https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/the-anarchist-faq-editorial-collective-an-anarchist-faq).
But I would be hard pressed to call this a victory for the anti-establishment,
though only time will tell. What it is, however, is a victory for white
supremacy. It is a vote for change, whatever that ends up being, at the
expense of people of colour, the LGBT+ community, Muslims, other marginalized
people, and possibly even the very future of our planet itself. That isn't
hyperbole when the President-elect has said he will use nuclear weapons and
doesn't believe in climate change.

If you don't want to be a bad guy, then you can't support Trump. There is no
middle ground on this one. Trump can not be divorced from his hateful rhetoric.
This man has already had terrible consequences for marginalized people, and his
election only makes it worse. If you are against hatred, you must also be
against Trump.
