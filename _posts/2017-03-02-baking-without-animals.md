Every time there is a birthday party at school or daycare, one of three
situations unfold:   
  
1. Parents who have the luxury of not thinking about food issues bring
whatever they want to celebrate, leaving children who don’t consume animal
products (either due to allergies, ethics, or culture) as the odd ones out, 

2. Parents give a warning to the class that they will be bringing in food, and
give the opportunity for the parents of effected kids to provide an equivalent
option (a not unreasonable solution), or 3. Parents give a warning *and* bring
in food that does not contain the offending ingredients, allowing the other
parents to evaluate the risk.
  
In my children’s classes, the biggest allergies aside from nuts and peanuts are
eggs and dairy. People are already used to the idea of not bringing foods with
nots or peanuts. 20 years ago, this was controversial. Now it is expected
behaviour.

But in the list of the most common food allergens, eggs, dairy, and
fish/shellfish make the top 5 list, and in increasing number of people are also
choosing to eschew those ingredients, for themselves and their children, for
ethical and environmental reasons.

Yet it is incredibly common for parents, even knowing that it could seriously
injure or kill a child, to [bring those ingredients into the
classroom](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/hamilton/news/student-allergy-prompts-human-rights-complaint-against-school-1.2496310).
I suspect the major reason for this insistence is due to the lack of awareness
of the alternatives, and the ease with which they can be incorporated into
everyday recipes.

## Alternatives to Cow’s Milk

Cow’s milk is incredibly easy to replace under most circumstances. Pretty much
every grocery store in Montreal now has a plethora of dairy-free alternatives,
including (but not limited to!) soy milk, almond milk, coconut milk, and rice
milk. And of those bases, you find option (and sometimes combinations) of sugar
free, original flavoured, vanilla flavoured, chocolate flavoured, and more.

In baking, you can usually replace cow’s milk 1:1 with one of these other milks.
If your recipe calls for buttermilk, you can stir in a couple of teaspoons of
vinegar into 1 cup of milk and let it sit for a few minutes before using it in
your recipe.

Things to be careful for when using dairy-free milks are: 

1. Not all of them are suitable for vegans.  If the milk is supplemented with
D3, then chances are that the D3 is from a cheap source such as sheep’s wool,
and not mushrooms. Milk that is suitable for vegans is generally fortified with
vitamin D2.  

2. Not all dairy-free milk is allergy friendly. Be careful when selecting if
there are nut allergies or soy allergies and use one of the alternatives, such
as rice milk or oat milk.
  
## Alternatives to Chicken’s Eggs

Chicken’s eggs can be a bit tougher to replace, as it will depend on the
function that the egg serves in the recipe. In the case of most baked goods,
such as muffins, cookies, and cake, one of the following substitutions will
work perfectly:

My personal favourites are mashed banana, or ground flax seeds.
