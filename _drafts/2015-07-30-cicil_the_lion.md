> "A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic." -- Joseph Stalin

For those of you who have been discsonnected from all forms of media this past
week, Cecil was a lion living in a national park in Zimbabwe who was lured out
of the park and killed by a trophy hunter. The news has identified an American
dentist as the culprit, who allegedly paid two locals $55,000 USD for the hunt.

The who and why don't really matter however. Don't get me wrong. I feel 
terrible for Cecil. It is tragic that he was killed so cruely. It is tragic
that his cubs will likely be killed by the next lion to take over his pride. 
But what is particularly interesting has been the world's reaction to this
tragedy.

In the days since a tentative identification of the killer has been made,
the Internet has meted out switft revenge. The website and social media sites
for his dental practice have been closed. One star reviews on Yelp have been
pouring in. Celebrities like Ricky Gervais and Cara Delevingne have been 
leading the charge. Petitions have popped up urgin the dentis to be extradited
to Zimbabwe to be charged alongside the two people he paid for the hunt. Death
threats have been pooring in.

In short: People are outraged over the callous cold blooded killing of another
animal for pleasure.

As a vegan, there is some particular irony here. Gary Francione has 
[written](http://articles.philly.com/2009-08-14/news/24986151_1_atlanta-falcons-quarterback-vick-illegal-dog-dog-fights) 
about this phenomenon before. Human beings are routinely responsible for the
unnecessary suffering and death of other animals. The science is clear: humans
don't need to eat animal products in order to be healthy. Obviously we can find
other options to entertain us, and our choices for animal-free textiles has 
never been greater. Barring food deserts and access to fresh foods, a real
problem in many places in North America and elsewhere in the world, the reason
that most people consume animal products is becuase they take pleasure in the
act, much like this dentist took pleasure in his hunt.

If you are not vegan, and you are angry or upset about Cecil's death, I would
strongly urge you to examine those feelings and consider what you can do to
change your own life to live by those ethics. It starts with becoming vegan.

If you are a vegan, there are some interesting lessons to learn here that can
help influence our activism. You will no doubt have noticed that the media has
not referred to Cecil as an "it". He has always had the proper pronoun applied.
Something that is never afforded to other nonhuman animal victims in the news.
Part of the rage surrounding Cecil is that people have been able to connect
with him as an individual. It helps that he is not a species of animal that
humans typically associate with food, becuase the research has shown time and
again that humans are more prone to deny a mind to animals that they intend on
eating. 

It also helps that he was not a statistic. Mother Teresa once said "if I look 
at the mass I will never act." When people as opposite as Mother Teresa and
Joseph Stalin agree on something, it is probably worth further investigation.
As it turns out, the propensity for humans to turn away from mass suffering has
been well documented. Deborah Small and Paul Slovic describe the phenomenon as
[compassion collapse]().
