>Children are free moral agents and have a right to be exposed to a range of beliefs well beyond the rigid doctrinal confines of their parent's faith, and we have an obligation to insist that they be so exposed, at least in public schools, if not elsewhere. -- Tim Wise

This was a hard lesson for me to learn.  As parents, we try to teach our children what we believe is best.  We teach them to be kind to others.  We teach them to share.  We teach them to stand up for themselves, and when possible to stand up for other as well.  We teach them our own beliefs and traditions.  We teach them as best we can.

But we are not the sole influences in our children's lives.  Nor should we be.  My parents installed some very important foundational beliefs in me, but my beliefs and subsequently my actions, really began to develop when I was exposed to other people in elementary school who were so concerned about the well-being of other animals that they did not eat them.  This was before the Internet.  These days, there are animal rights books in my son's school's library.  Times are a changin'.
