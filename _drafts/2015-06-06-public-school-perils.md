>Children are free moral agents and have a right to be exposed to a range of beliefs well beyond the rigid doctrinal confines of their parent's faith, and we have an obligation to insist that they be so exposed, at least in public schools, if not elsewhere. -- Tim Wise


I am fortunate to be friends with many other amazing radical parents.  Parents who want to change the world, and who are not afraid to want to help their children to change the world.  The one big thing that we all share in common, is our frustration with the schools that we have available to us, both public and private.
